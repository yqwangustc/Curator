    On exception, waits ``2 ** attempt`` seconds before retrying, up to
    ``max_retries`` attempts total.  The final failure is re-raised so the
    caller can decide how to propagate it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : Callable[[], Awaitable]
        Zero-argument callable returning a fresh coroutine.  Invoked once
        per attempt so the retry produces a fresh awaitable each time.
    max_retries : int
        Maximum number of attempts. Defaults to :data:`MAX_RETRIES`.
    backend_name : str
        Human-readable backend label used in log messages
        (e.g. ``"AWS"``, ``"Google"``).
    non_retryable : tuple[type[BaseException], ...]
        Exception classes that should be re-raised immediately without
        retrying (e.g. ``ValueError`` for input-size violations).

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        Whatever ``fn()`` resolves to on success.
