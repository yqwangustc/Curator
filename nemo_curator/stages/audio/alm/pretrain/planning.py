    The gap constraint matters for ALM pretraining: two segments

    conversations (e.g. a topic change, an ad break, two takes recorded
    back to back), and a snippet that bridges them would teach the model
    to associate unrelated content.  Closing the snippet at long gaps
    keeps each training example semantically coherent.

    this upstream in the pipeline.  If overlapping segments are passed in,

    """Drop planned snippets whose text shows suspicious n-gram repetition.

    Whisper-style ASR sometimes degenerates into repeating the same
    short phrase for many seconds; the resulting transcript looks fine
    locally but contains the same n-gram of token ids dozens of times.
    Such snippets are unsuitable for pretraining.

    For every planned snippet (read from ``task.data["_snippet_plan"]``)
    we join the segment ``text`` fields with the same formula the
    extractor uses, tokenize with the configured HuggingFace fast
    tokenizer, count n-gram frequencies over the resulting token-id
    sequence, and drop the snippet if any n-gram appears strictly more
    than ``ngram_max_count`` times.  Filtered snippets are logged with
    the offending occurrences highlighted in red (loguru color tags).

    Snippets whose tokenized text has fewer than ``ngram_n`` tokens are
    kept unchanged (no n-grams to evaluate; the planner already enforces
    a minimum-duration threshold).

    Sits between :class:`SnippetCutPlannerStage` and
    :class:`SnippetExtractionStage` so filtered snippets never incur
    audio decode / resample / file-write cost.

    ``tokenizer_path`` is either a local directory loadable by
    ``AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`` or a HuggingFace Hub repository id
    (e.g. ``openai/whisper-large-v3``).  When it's a repo id, the
    tokenizer is fetched once per node in :meth:`setup_on_node` so
    workers in :meth:`setup` only ever read from the local cache.
