"""Driver-side prepare/finalize helpers and shard mergers.

Pipeline writers (manifest, metrics, audio tar) all emit one shard file

to clean up stale shards, merge fresh shards into the user-visible
output files, and reconcile manifest rows against the final tar.

    """Reconcile the merged metrics summary against the post-reconcile manifest.

    Worker shards are written before ``_reconcile_manifest_with_tar`` can
    prune manifest rows whose audio is missing or unreadable, so the
    initial ``_merge_metrics_shards`` summary overcounts on the output
    side by exactly the number of rows the reconcile pass removed.  This
    helper:

    1. Increments ``dropped.missing_audio`` and ``dropped.corrupted_audio``
       with the reconcile pass's drop counts (so reconcile drops are
       attributable separately from worker-side filters like ``empty`` /
       ``overlap``).
    2. Rebuilds the output-side counters -- ``num_output_snippets``,
       ``output_total_segments``, ``output_total_duration_sec``,
       ``snippet_duration_histogram_30s``, and each
       ``per_original[*].out_*`` field -- by walking the now-authoritative
       (post-reconcile) manifest.  Input-side and worker-side dropped
       counters are left untouched.

    No-op when both reconcile counts are zero (the merged metrics already
    match the manifest) or when the metrics file doesn't exist (dry run
    / reconcile-in-isolation tests).
