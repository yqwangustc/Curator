# Process Data for Text Curation

Process text data you've loaded through NeMo Curator's {ref}`pipeline architecture <about-concepts-text-data-loading>`.

NeMo Curator provides a comprehensive suite of tools for processing text data as part of the AI training pipeline. These tools help you analyze, transform, and filter your text datasets to ensure high-quality input for language model training.

## How It Works

NeMo Curator's text processing capabilities are organized into five main categories:

1. **Language Management**: Handle multilingual content, translation, and language-specific processing
2. **Content Processing & Cleaning**: Clean, normalize, and transform text content
3. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate and near-duplicate documents efficiently
4. **Quality Assessment & Filtering**: Score and remove low-quality content using heuristics and ML classifiers
5. **Specialized Processing**: Domain-specific processing for code and advanced curation tasks

Each category provides specific implementations optimized for different curation needs. The result is a cleaned and filtered dataset ready for model training.

## Deduplication

Remove duplicate and near-duplicate documents efficiently from your text datasets. All deduplication methods support both identification (finding duplicates) and removal (filtering them out) workflows.
